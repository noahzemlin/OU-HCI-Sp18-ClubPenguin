The new gamer will be someone that has only very recently been gaming. Specifically, a high school male in America. This user has a small to moderate sized game collection that he hopes to be able to sort and organize. He enjoys playing the same few games of his library over and over again, but is always looking for something new and adds free or cheap indie games somewhat frequently to his library.
The elder gamer isn’t someone who is necessarily very experienced with gaming, but rather just a physically old person. I’m imagining a 60 something year old male grandpa that was in the military for 20 years. His eyesight is not the greatest and has problems reading small text. This user loves their simulation games as well as board game style games like Civilization. He is looking to use our program to organize through his moderate sized game collection simply because he likes organization.
The rich gamer is someone who has been playing games for a long time, but stumbled upon a large sum of wealth during his last 7 years working in engineering. He has been able to buy every hot new game, regardless of whether he would play it or not. As a result, he has amassed a huge library of games that are on many different platforms but all installed on his computer. He is looking for an application that would allow him to sort through his library and find games to play.
