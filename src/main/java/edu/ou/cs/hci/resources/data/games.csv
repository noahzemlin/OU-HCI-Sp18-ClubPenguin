A team wins by being the first to destroy a large structure located in the opposing team's base, called ""The Ancient"".",Valve Corporation,Valve Corporation,MOBA,,dota2.jpg,

Players on a team work together to secure and defend control points on a map or escort a payload across the map in a limited amount of time. Players gain cosmetic rewards that do not affect gameplay, such as character skins and victory poses, as they play the game. The game was initially launched with casual play, with a competitive ranked mode, various 'arcade' game modes, and a player-customizable server browser subsequently included following its release. Additionally, Blizzard has developed and added new characters, maps, and game modes post-release, while stating that all Overwatch updates will remain free, with the only additional cost to players being microtransactions to earn additional cosmetic rewards.",Blizzard Entertainment,Blizzard Entertainment,First-person Shooter,,Overwatch.jpg,
